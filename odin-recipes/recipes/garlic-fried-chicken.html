    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Garlic-Fried Chicken is a savory and crispy dish that's packed with flavor. This recipe features succulent pieces of chicken marinated in a garlicky buttermilk mixture, which tenderizes the meat and infuses it with a robust garlic flavor.

        The chicken is then coated in a seasoned flour mixture and fried to golden perfection, resulting in a crispy, flavorful crust with a juicy interior. Ideal for family dinners, picnics, or any occasion where you crave comfort food with a garlicky twist.
